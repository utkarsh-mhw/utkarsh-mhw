## Hi there 👋

I’m Utkarsh, a graduate student at **Georgia Tech**. My work sits at the intersection of **data science, and strategy**, with a focus on building practical, application-driven ML solutions.

### What I Work On

My projects are application-focused and emphasize:
- Translating messy, real-world data into actionable insights
- Applied machine learning and analytics for real-world problems  
- Decision-oriented analytics rather than model performance alone  
- Ensuring explainability and assumption testing in models  

### Featured Work

- **[NutriLens](https://github.com/utkarsh-mhw/NutriLens)**  
  An intelligent food recommendation system that analyzes nutritional labels and suggests healthier alternatives, with a focus on interpretability and real-world usability.

- **[WhyHere?](https://github.com/utkarsh-mhw/WhyHereTool)**  
  An explainable neighborhood recommendation system for Atlanta that helps users identify suitable areas based on personalized priorities such as safety, affordability, transit access, and amenities.
